Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')
```
In this function, we first create a function called doubleL passing a parameter called n. next we create a an empty list called res. Next, we iterate over the n using the range function from 0 which returns a sequence of numbers . next, we append the number at the end of the list by multiplying it by 2. after that we return the list "res".  
1) 
Next we run a for loop iterates over each element in the list returned by doubleL(5), and it iterates over the list and it gives the output by multiplying followed by a colon and a space.

The code will generate something like: [0,3,6,9,12] and prints it like 0 : 2 : 4 : 6 : 8
2)
#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
```
This also creates a list of [0,2,4,6,8] however it does not including the number 5

```

Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')
```
The function does the same thing as above, its a double G generator function that takes a single argument of n. it uses the yield keyword which returns the object and produces items on demand.
This function doesn't return anything, but it remembers its state so it can continue iterating and yielding values when called again.



DoubleG is a generator function which yields items on at a time, using yield keyword instead of reuturning a list of items at once. But in some cases, it can also return all the items together.
